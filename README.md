# Makeover Monday (MoM) - Week 39
**Child Marriage - A Look at Central Africa**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## Source Article and Viz
This week's Viz: Week 39 brings [a viz](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w39/workspace/project-summary?agentid=makeovermonday&datasetid=2020w39) showing child marriage rates across the world.

## Data Source
Data comes from UNICEF [here](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/child-marriage/).

## My Approach for Week 38
The original viz is a map and accompanying bar (nested) chart showing rates of child marriage for various countries.  I chose to focus on the countries with the highest rates of child marriage for each of the three categories (girls married by 15, girls married by 18, and boys married by 18), which just so happen to neighbor each other in central Africa.  I also experimented with radial bar charts using a tutorial from [SuperDataScience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6qEG7AyDYo) but I'm not sure that I like them over a standard bar chart.
